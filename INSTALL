Instructions on building the SAC R utilities.

It is assumed that you have a functioning R and a functioning SAC available.

1.  Configure for build.  This locates the libraries needed to link xapiir.

    ./configure

2.  Make the R routines.

    make

3.  Test results.
    Invoke R and issue

    source('sacutils.R')
    sacdemo()

    If you see a plot of a seismogram, congratulations!  If you don't,
    troubleshoot your build.  Areas to focus on:
    
    * Do you lack some libraries that you need to include on the R CMD SHLIB
    command?  These will show up when you issue the source() command in R.
    It will complain about being unable to load the package.

    * Is your C compiler (used by R) compiling the same format binary as the
    Fortran compiler did when it built xapiir?  The flags -m32 and -m64 might
    help; you also might need to replace your version of R or rebuild your
    version of SAC (and xapiir).
